<H1> Hello, my name is alexander temple, it has been awhile since ive touched html, css, and javascript, infact I dont really know javascript tbh </H1>
<p> I wanted to test a couple things out on this website, such as calling javascript functions via buttons, creating variables based of user input, and also checking those variables against stuff using if statments. </p>
  <br>
  <p1> (also making stuff look cool with css) </p1>
<br>
<br>
  <div1>
    <p3> Here is a button that will check you age.
       </p3>
       <br>
       <br>
       <button onclick=agecheck()> Agecheck </button>
    </div1>
</body>
